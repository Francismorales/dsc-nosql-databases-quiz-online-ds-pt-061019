    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a structured relational database (columns and rows). It is vertically scalable. Fixed and predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL is a document and distributed database. It is horizontally scalable. Dynamic schema \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To store large volumes of data\n",
    "To speed-up development time\n",
    "If your domain objects do not fit well in a relational database schema\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a distributed database (not all storage devices are attached to a common processor). Relational databases are not\n",
    "network connected like distributed databases.\n",
    "MongoDB stores data into flexible JSON like documents, whereas relational databases follow the table-row-column structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault-tolerance is the capability of a computer system or a network to deliver uninterurpted service, despite of one or more\n",
    "of its components failing. \n",
    "\n",
    "An RDD is a partitioned collection of records. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions across many servers so\n",
    "that they can be computed on different nodes of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDD lineage graph [DAG] allows RDDs to be fault-tolerant by allowing to recompute missing or damaged partitions due to node \n",
    "failures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is a programming model designed for processing large volumes of data in parallel by dividing the work into a set\n",
    "of independent tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
